# MazeStory
Maze game inspired by 'MapleStory', built using Java and JavaFX while following SOLID principles, implementing common search algorithms, design patterns, concurrency, etc.

* Maze generator algorithms: Empty maze, Simple maze, MyMaze (random maze with atleast one solution)
* Solving algorithms implemented: Breadth First Search, Best First Search, Depth First Search
* Design patterns implemented: Factory, Bridge, Observer, MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel)
* RLE (Run-length encoding) Compression implemented, allowing the user to save and load compressed maze's created by the game
* TCP networking local simulation, to generate and solve mazes
* Using ThreadPool, allowing for the creation of mazes and solving them concurrently
